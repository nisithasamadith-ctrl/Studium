Since Node.js and Git aren't installing properly, here are **easier alternatives** that work in your browser:

## Option 1: StackBlitz (RECOMMENDED - Easiest)

**Get a URL in 5 minutes, zero installation needed!**

### Steps:

## Still Want to Try Local Installation?

If you want to keep trying with Node.js:
- Make sure you downloaded from **nodejs.org** (not another site)
- Run installer **as Administrator** (right-click → Run as Administrator)
- **Restart your entire computer** (not just PowerShell)
- Check: `node --version` in a NEW PowerShell window
